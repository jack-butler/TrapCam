# TrapCam
The TrapCam repository contains instructions and software to construct a TrapCam.

If you are using a WittyPi2, clone the master branch of this repository.
If you are using a WittyPi3, clone the v2 branch of this repository.

# Initial set up
#
The Raspberry Pi uses a microSD card as it's "internal" drive, on which
the Linux-based Raspbian OS will be installed. I recommend using the
"Lite" version of the OS - which lacks the GUI - but the TrapCam
software should also work with the GUI version of the OS.

Firstly, you need to format your microSD as FAT or FAT32. Next, use
Etcher to flash the Raspbian OS image to the microSD card. Once flashed,
remove the microSD from your computer and insert it into the rPi will
it's unplugged.

Plug in a keyboard and a monitor, and then plug in the rPi. Be sure the
monitor is on before you plug in the rPi, otherwise the rPi won't output
to the screen.

# Configure the rPI
#
You'll probably be asked to log in upon first boot. Username = pi,
Password = raspberry

Once logged in, run "sudo raspi-config" to access the configuration
tool, and alter these settings:
1. Change User Password
	* Change the password from the default
2. Network Options
	* Change hostname to "trapcam" (if you are building more than one,
	  it might be useful to number them sequentially, i.e., "trapcam1", "trapcam2", etc.)
3. Boot Options
    * Desktop/CLI - set to "Console autologin"
    * Wait for network at boot: No
4. Localisation Options:
    * Change timezone to your timezone
    * Change keyboard layout to the keyboard you are using (likely standard US English)
5. Interface Options
    * Enable Camera Interface: Yes

Use the right arrow to select "Finish", and reboot.

Once rebooted, run "sudo apt update", then "sudo echo "y" | sudo apt upgrade" to update
packages. After updating/upgrading, you'll need to re-run "sudo raspi-config" and reset
the rPi to boot to "Console autologin" again (#3 above) and reboot.

Once up-to-date, you need to install a few packages and add-ons that the TrapCam
software depends on. Run "sudo apt install git" to install Git, and "sudo apt install fbi"
to install framebuffer, and then reboot (I know, I know, it's a lot of rebooting...)

Next, install WiringPi using git. In your home directory (if you're unsure of where that
is or worry that you aren't there, simply "cd $HOME" or "cd ~"), clone WiringPi by
running "git clone https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi.git". That will download the
WiringPi toolset into a WiringPi directory in your $HOME directory. Move into the
WiringPi directory ("cd WiringPi/"), and run "./build" to compile the WiringPi tools.

To control rPi's duty cycle, we'll use the WittyPi 2 HAT, but first we need to install
the WittyPi software. DO NOT ATTACH THE WITTY PI BEFORE INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE. Move
back into $HOME, and run  "wget http://www.uugear.com/repo/WittyPi2/installWittyPi.sh"
to download the installer. Run "sudo sh installWittyPi.sh" to install the software, and
reboot yet again. Once the software is installed, you can power off the rPi and attach
the WittyPi. If you'd like, you can "sudo rm installWittyPi.sh" to keep your $HOME
directory clean.

Finally, you need to install the TrapCam software using git. Move into $HOME, and run
"git clone https://github.com/jack-butler/TrapCam" to clone the software into the TrapCam
directory. Move into the TrapCam directory ("cd TrapCam/"), and run "sudo bash
installTrapCam.sh". This installer will copy the configs, services, and scripts to their
correct locations.

# Schedule Scripts

The TrapCam software comes with default schedule scripts that duty cycle the rPi. The
first schedule (TrapCam_duty_cycle.wpi) turns the rPi on for 5 minutes on the 10s -
that is, at :00, :10, :20 minutes, etc. past the hour, 24 hours a day. The second schedule
(TrapCam_8AM_wakeup.wpi) is used once battery limitations preclude using underwater
lights, and runs the rPi on the same duty cycle above, just between the hours of 7AM and
7PM.

These schedule scripts provide good temporal coverage throughout the day, but users can
create their own schedule scripts if they so choose. The WittyPi user's manual can be
found at http://www.uugear.com/doc/WittyPi_UserManual.pdf and provides good info on how
to create unique schedule scripts. As long as the script is named "TrapCam_duty_cycle.wpi",
the TrapCam script will copy it to the correct location and load that duty cycle.

# Lighting for nighttime video

By default, the TrapCam software assumes there are lights for nighttime videography. The
lights outlined in the build instructions are 6W LED lights, and greatly increase the
battery drain at night. If unaccounted for in the software, once the battery power drops
below the 12V needed to power the lights the rPi could freeze and miss a scheduled shutdown,
leading to a camera that doesn't wake up to take video any longer. To account for this,
the TrapCam software only runs the lights during the first week of deployment.

If you're system doesn't have lights, or if you have enough battery to power the lights
past the one week limit, you can alter the TrapCam.sh code. Lines 33-36 provide an
if-statement to tell the rPi at what date to no longer turn on the lights. To alter the
length of time that lights are powered, change the "+6 days" on Line 35 to however long
you think your batteries can power the lights (that is, how long they can provide greater
than 12V). If you aren't running TrapCam with lights at all, simply comment out or remove
Lines 33-36 and the script will skip turning on lights.

IMPORTANT: You need to manually remove the nolights.txt file from $HOME before every new
deployment. If you don't, the rPi will probably think it's past the date at which are
operable and will not turn them on. To do this, "sudo rm nolights.txt", and the script
will automatically create the new txt file with the correct date at which the lights
will no longer turn on.
